This is my implementation of the tag picker. Thanks very much for the offer to undertake this task.

If I were to spend more time on this, I would include:
- testing of components rendering
- an audit of any accessibility issues
- styling changes:
    - remove underline underneath new tag text input
    - border colour to be darker than tag background colour
- alternatives for mouse hover events if on mobile/touch device
